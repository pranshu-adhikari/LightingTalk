# LightingTalk

Base: Python 3.9.7

1. Download entire folder to run demo

2. Open main.py.ipynb
    - To run program, click run-all twice (for some reason code fails the first run-all)
    - Restart the kernel if you want to re-run the app (otherwise, the original interface will not clear and the new interface will overlay on top of original)

Note: Make sure all files are in the folder and callable. Otherwise, the GUI window will be empty or the code will fail.
